All the modules are mentioned with versions in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Sayad-Uddin-Tahsin/BBC-Bangla-API/blob/main/requirements.txt). You can use `pip install -r requirements.txt` after cloning the Repository, this will automatically install all the Modules mentioned/needed!

## How to use?
Once you run the [Code](https://github.com/Sayad-Uddin-Tahsin/BBC-Bangla-API/blob/main/main.py), a piece of URL will be printed in your `Console`!
If you click the url you should get a result `{"status":"OK"}` according to [Line: 11 - 14](https://github.com/Sayad-Uddin-Tahsin/BBC-Bangla-API/blob/a36ebc89927ccc141998cb2ed9f2aa6b358501aa/main.py#L11-L14). https://github.com/Sayad-Uddin-Tahsin/BBC-Bangla-API/blob/a36ebc89927ccc141998cb2ed9f2aa6b358501aa/main.py#L11-L14
If the Status says `OK` that means you've configured `Flask` perfectely! Now you just need to add `/news` after the Link printed before!
It should take some time to give the output because It need to fetch every single News of [BBC Bangla](https://bbc.com/bengali).

If you don't see any URL printed as String in your console, don't worry! There must an output like 
```py
 * Serving Flask app 'main'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
 * Running on http://192.168.0.102:8080
Press CTRL+C to quit
```
There you can see 2 URLs are automatically generated by `Flask`! You can use any of them but you won't able to share it with anyone because this URL are only usable for the same Wi-Fi you are currently connected!

**NOTE: IF ANY ERROR OCCURED, FEEL FREE TO CREATE AN [ISSUE](https://github.com/Sayad-Uddin-Tahsin/BBC-Bangla-API/issues)**
